APCS-Final-Fall14
Sudoku Game
=================
This project first generates a finished sudoku puzzle, removes numbers randomly (while still checking that the game is solveable), then lets users plug in the values using GUI and checks if they're correct or not. Multiple difficulty levels, and an option to show a possible solution (the one that we started with). Users could potentially choose how big the Sudoku puzzle'll be, given that users provide a non-prime number. (this may be hopeful dreaming.)
