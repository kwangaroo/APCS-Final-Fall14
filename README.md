APCS-Final-Fall14
Sudoku Game
=================
This project first generates a finished sudoku puzzle, removes numbers randomly (while still checking that the game is solveable), then lets users plug in the values using GUI and checks if they're correct or not. Multiple difficulty levels, and an option to show a possible solution (the one that we started with). Users could potentially choose how big the Sudoku puzzle'll be, given that users provide a non-prime number. (this may be hopeful dreaming.)

Bare Bones (1/6/15):<br>
1.fillBoard(size) - creates a finished board. <br>
2. remove() -  randomly removes numbers from finished board (number removed depends on difficulty) <br>
3. solver() - check if the board is still solvable, <br>
4. checker() - Check solutions<br>
5. printSoln() -  print out the original solution<br>
6. toString()<br>
<br>
1/7/15: created GUI file - coded basic layout of the interface<br>
1/8/15: tried to create sudoku board<br>
1/9/15: add menu bar and dropdown choices for GUI<br>
	error and row switch<br>
1/12/15: added checker for rows and columns, also scrambler <br>
1/13/15: fixed more compiling errors, coded checker for groups. in addition, realized it was 2015, not 2014, and we've been typing the date wrong this entire project. we have fixed this problem. Also, worked on making the grid for the sudoku board<br>
1/14/15: put in main and made code less complicated; and continued working on the grid board <br>
